## About the Project: 
Cuora is an open source college discussion forum which will allow students to post notice or information related to college events. Under every post, the students can openly have discussion or clarify their doubts. The forum will also allow the students to create an event reminder. 
Additionally, since a lot of learning and knowledge sharing happens during discussions such an application which provides students a platform can be really very beneficial in learning and knowledge sharing. It provides both students and teachers an interactive platform to connect. People (i.e., students and teachers) and administration authority can easily post about various upcoming events, programs, competition etc all in one place. Also, the application provides the functionality to save information regarding any event for a certain period of time, so that the useful and necessary information does not get lost and a maximum number of students can utilize the opportunities which come their way and which brings value and skill addition to them. 
It is an attempt to bring a virtual college life experience through a web application.
